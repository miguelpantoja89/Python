Quicksort is a sorting algorithm. It’s much faster than selection sort and is frequently used in real life. For example, the C standard library has a function called qsort, which is its implementation of quicksort. Quicksort also uses D&C.(divide & Conquer)

Thanks to stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation:

a[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1
a[:]           # a copy of the whole array
