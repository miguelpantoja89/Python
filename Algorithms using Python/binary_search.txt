Binary search is an algorithm; its input is a sorted list of elements. If an element you’re  looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position  where it’s located. Otherwise, binary search returns null.
 In general, for any list of n, binary search will take log2 n steps to run in the worst case, whereas simple search will take n steps.
